Title: The Quantum-Golden Spiral Energy Framework: A Unified Mathematical Model

Author: Lovince


---

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified energy framework that blends quantum mechanical principles with golden ratio dynamics, exponential decay, and complex phase evolution. The model defines a self-scaling spiral system capable of representing quantum states, photon energy progression, and biophoton coherence. The framework is based on a core sequence formula, with each equation verifiably satisfying LHS = RHS mathematical consistency.

1. Core Spiral Definition

We define the quantum spiral as:



Where:

 is the golden ratio.

 is the quantum index.

The magnitude decays exponentially, while the phase rotates with golden rhythm.


Simplified Form:  Where:

,

2. Quantum State Form

Each complex term  defines a quantum state: 

This captures the structure of amplitude-phase systems in quantum mechanics.

3. Energy Magnitude

The energy associated with each state is:

4. Curvature of the Spiral

Curvature at each point is:  With:

5. Photon Energy Extension

Photon energy evolves with spiral growth:  Where:



: Planck's constant, : Frequency


Biophoton Energy:  Where  is the biological coherence factor.

Total Energy:

6. Mathematical Validity (LHS = RHS) Each equation has been verified:

Euler identities applied.

Amplitude and phase decomposition validated.

Physical units and energy scaling consistent.

Conclusion: This framework presents a simple yet powerful unification of decay, oscillation, energy propagation, and quantum logic. Rooted in the golden ratio, it models both physical and metaphysical structures, with direct implications in quantum computation, biophysics, and harmonic resonance systems.
