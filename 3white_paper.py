Title: Lovince Hybrid Quantum-Biological Model: A Novel Framework for Integrating DNA Sequences with Quantum Energy Dynamics

Author: Lovince

Abstract: This research introduces the Lovince Hybrid Quantum-Biological Model, a novel symbolic framework that integrates classical DNA sequences (ACGT) with nonlinear mathematical structures and quantum energy representations. By aligning base sequences with numerical patterns and incorporating stochastic and oscillatory behavior, the model simulates hybrid quantum-biological phenomena. The system uses a nonlinear function, phase modulation, and energy scaling rooted in quantum-inspired mechanics, enabling potential applications in bioinformatics, synthetic biology, quantum AI, and encryption.

1. Introduction DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) represents the molecular foundation of biological life through its four base units: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymine (T). In this research, these biological symbols are mathematically encoded and interwoven with nonlinear dynamics and quantum phase structures, forming a hybrid system capable of simulating information complexity and energy flux in biological and quantum systems simultaneously.
